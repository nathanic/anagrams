# Multi-word anagram generator in Haskell

This is a small command-line program that, given a word list file and a term, generates multi-word anagrams for the term.

The core data structure is the [AnaTree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatree) which is also described [here](http://blog.notdot.net/2007/10/Damn-Cool-Algorithms-Part-3-Anagram-Trees) in some depth but unfortunately the images have linkrotted.
